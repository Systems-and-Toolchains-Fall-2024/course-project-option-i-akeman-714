### Overview
Provide a brief summary of the purpose of your course project, including objectives and key deliverables.

### Task Structure
The code is organized into four main tasks, each performing distinct functions related to the project goals. In the local notebook (`course_project_local_final_11_12.ipynb`), Tasks 1, 2, and 3 are clearly divided by markdown sections, while Task 4 is handled separately.

# Dataset Feature Description

This dataset is already cleaned.Features with high nullValue ratio are already dropped. URL columns are also dropped. The nullValues has been imputed. For the detail of **DATA CLEANING**, please refer to ```course_project.ipynb```

Based on my understanding of this dataset, some features in this dataset could be furtherly cleaned or developped based on the need of the ML model, including:
- 'nationality_id/nationality_name'
- 'work_rate'

Two features could be dropped (represented by other columns or just useless), including:
- 'body_type'
- 'real_face'_

Below is a detailed explanation of each feature in the dataset.üêà

---

## Output

- **overall**
  - **Description**: The player's overall value.(Supervised Learning output)

## Personal Attributes

- **preferred_foot**

  - **Type**: Integer

- **work_rate**
  - **Description**: The player's work rate in attack and defense, formatted as 'Attacking Work Rate/Defensive Work Rate' (e.g., 'High/Medium').

  - **Type**: String
  - **Note**: This one is a little tricky to use. There's a (height) after the body type. I think that this column could be dropped because we could use height_cm and weight_kg (features introduced in the basic information section) to represent the body type. And this is more like a classified result, which isn't stronger than numerical features.

# PostgreSQL or NoSQL?

Given that the dataset is highly structured, with comprehensive and consistent rows and columns, using a relational database like PostgreSQL offers significant advantages over a NoSQL database. PostgreSQL is designed to handle structured data efficiently, providing strict schema enforcement, data integrity, and consistency through features like ACID transactions and data constraints. It ensures that the data adheres to a predefined schema, preventing invalid data entries. In contrast, NoSQL databases are better suited for unstructured or semi-structured data, lacking strict schema enforcement, which can lead to data inconsistency in highly structured datasets like this one. In summary, for datasets with a fixed schema, PostgreSQL provides a more appropriate and reliable solution compared to NoSQL databases.

# CODE WALKTHROUGH

The final course project local code is `course_project_local_final_11_12.ipynb`. For the cloud version of the code, refer to `course_project_final cloud_11_14.ipynb`

The code is organized into four main tasks, each performing distinct functions related to the project goals. In the local notebook (`course_project_local_final_11_12.ipynb`), Tasks 1, 2, and 3 are clearly divided by markdown sections, while Task 4 is handled separately.

In the following sections, the code and functions will be introduced in the order they appear in the notebook.

## TASK I

### Import SPARK

In this section, the configuration object for SPARK requires change. First, if the user runs the code on MacOs, they should comment the findspark part of the code. Secondly, the user may need to change the PostgreSQL path.(If the user's configuration of spark/postgresql accords the installation guide, then there shouldn't have any problems to run the code.

After importing some crucial modules, the database prooperties `db_properties`  are defined. `db_properties` will be used several times in the following code.

**In this cell, the user should replace the `username`,`password`with their own one.** 

For `table`, the user can remain it as `fifa.fifa_uncleaned`, the code will just overwrite/create a new table.

### Data Cleaning

**Run all the cells sequentially:**
- A. Reading the data
  - The user may need to replace the file path.
- B. Add new column
  - creating a column for the players year and gender
- C. Merge the data
  - Creating a UID for all players
  - Using the `overwrite` mode to write the uncleaned data `df_union` to PostgresSQL
- D. Data Cleaning
  - D.1 Dropping columns with high nullValue ratio
    - reading back the uncleaned df and naming it `df_uncleaned`
    - `replace_missing_values`: Transferring all the nullValues into `None`
    - `show_null_ratio`: Calculate different columns' null ratio
    - filter out the columns with nullValue ratio over 50%
    - dropping the url columns
  - D.2 Checking the dtypes
    - `add_schema_row`: Creating a df to check whether the columns' data have been correctly inferred or not
    - transferring position rating columns dtype and calculating the extra scores
  - D.3 Null Value Handling
    - I didn't know that we can ignore the female players data in TASK III, so female players' data were seperately treated.
    - The woman players high null ratio string columns were filled with unknown
    - For all players, string null values were filled with their columns' mode and numeric null values were filled with medians.
- E. Data Ingestion
  - I changed the dbtable name to `fifa.fifa_cleaned`

## TASK II

## TASK III

**Run all the cells sequentially:**

- A. Read the data back (Only use the male players' data)
- B. Phase 2 of Data Engineering
  - (1)-(5)
- C. Model Construction
  - Cont.(6)-(7)
  - SPARK
    - GBT regressor
    - Random Forest
  - PyTorch
    - Shallow NN
    - Ensemble NN
      
    **The user can choose to save the model they trained. But it would be better to change the name of the saved files, avoiding to cover the models I uploaded.**


# Dataset Feature Description

This dataset is already cleaned.Features with high nullValue ratio are already dropped. URL columns are also dropped. The nullValues has been imputed. For the detail of **DATA CLEANING**, please refer to ```course_project.ipynb```

Based on my understanding of this dataset, some features in this dataset could be furtherly cleaned or developped based on the need of the ML model, including:
- 'nationality_id/nationality_name'
- 'work_rate'

Two features could be dropped (represented by other columns or just useless), including:
- 'body_type'
- 'real_face'_

Below is a detailed explanation of each feature in the dataset.üêà

---

## Output

- **overall**
  - **Description**: The player's overall value.(Supervised Learning output)

  - **Note**: Could seperate this column into several columns representing the player's preferred positions by 0/1. But this columns information could be substituted by the column of position rating.

- **overall**
  - **Note: !!!This column isn't a input feature!!!** This column is listed here just to directly reflect the structure and the sequence of the dataframe/SQL database. In the ML process, this column should be dropped. The information of this column is introduced above.

- **work_rate**
  - **Description**: The player's work rate in attack and defense, formatted as 'Attacking Work Rate/Defensive Work Rate' (e.g., 'High/Medium').

  - 
- **body_type**
  - **Description**: The player's body type (e.g., 'Lean'(170-), 'Normal'(185),'Unique').
  - **Type**: String
  - **Note**: This one is a little tricky to use. There's a (height) after the body type. I think that this column could be dropped because we could use height_cm and weight_kg (features introduced in the basic information section) to represent the body type. And this is more like a classified result, which isn't stronger than numerical features.

  - **Description**: Indicates whether the player's face is accurately represented in the game.
  - **Type**: String ('Yes' or 'No')
  - **Note**: Useless feature.

# PostgreSQL or NoSQL?

Given that the dataset is highly structured, with comprehensive and consistent rows and columns, using a relational database like PostgreSQL offers significant advantages over a NoSQL database. PostgreSQL is designed to handle structured data efficiently, providing strict schema enforcement, data integrity, and consistency through features like ACID transactions and data constraints. It ensures that the data adheres to a predefined schema, preventing invalid data entries. In contrast, NoSQL databases are better suited for unstructured or semi-structured data, lacking strict schema enforcement, which can lead to data inconsistency in highly structured datasets like this one. In summary, for datasets with a fixed schema, PostgreSQL provides a more appropriate and reliable solution compared to NoSQL databases.
